This project can be broken down into three distinctive parts:

	** The assembler: **

			this is the program that will compile your champions 
		and translate them from the language you will write them
		in (assembly language) into “Bytecode”.Bytecode is a machine 
		code, which will be directly interpreted by the virtual
		machine

	** The virtual machine: **
	
			It’s the “arena” in which your champions will be executed.
		It offers various functions, all of which will be useful for the 
		battle of the champions. Obviously, the virtual machine should 
		allow for numerous simultaneous processes; we are asking you for
		a gladiator fight, not a one-man show simulator.

	** The champion: **

			This one is a special case. Later, in the championship, you will
		need to render a super powerful champion, who will scare the staff 
		team to death. However, rendering this kind of champion is serious work. 
		And since, for now, we are mostly interested in your capacity to create 
		Corewar’s other programs (i.e. the assembler and virtual machine), your 
		current champion will only need to prove to us that you can write bits 
		and pieces of Corewar ASM.

	** Skills Developped ** 
		
		-research into the processes of compiling and assembling.
		-translation of assembly code into byte code
		-creation of virtual machine that exectutes the byte code.
		-understanding of the workings of processes, registries and cycles.
		-Visualization of the workings of a machine on an area of memory.
